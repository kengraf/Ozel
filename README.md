Personal secrets are hard to maintain in a shared community like the Internet. Ozel provides for confidential storage of data using public resources without requiring trust. Ozel uses multiple storage providers and is designed to allow providers to fail, disclose, or destroy the data provided them without disclosing any of the user's original data.
